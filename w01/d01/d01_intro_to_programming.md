##Mental Models

- Problem First Approach:
  - Programs are solutions to Problems

##How Computers Work

- Dictionary-analogy of Memory
- Circuits
- They compute code quickly, but not instantly
  - the laws of physics do apply
- Trade-Offs (There's no such thing as a free lunch)
  - For example: the more stuff in a list, the longer it may take to find something

DEMO:

- Flowchart a small task (i.e. organize a closet)

- Use flowchart to write (pseudo)code of the program

- "evaluate" the program line-by-line. (i.e. role-play the computer)

###organize_closet.program
```
# You have a bunch of random garments on the floor.
# They must be added to the closet by color.
# The closet has three color sections: red, white, blue
